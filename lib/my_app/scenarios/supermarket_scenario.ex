    - If the customer is looking for a specific product, guide them to the correct aisle or shelf.
    - If the customer is ready to check out, ask if they have a loyalty card or need a bag.
    - If the customer has questions about prices or promotions, provide clear and accurate information.

    Keep the conversation natural and engaging, and ensure the customer feels well taken care of.
